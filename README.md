# LeetCode Solutions in Java

Welcome to my repository where I share solutions to various **LeetCode** problems, all implemented in **Java**. This repository is continuously updated with solutions to problems I solve during my coding journey.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by LeetCode problem numbers, where each problem's solution is stored in a dedicated folder. Every solution includes detailed code implementations with comments to enhance readability.

## LeetCode Hard 75 Series

The repository also includes solutions for the **LeetCode Hard 75** series. These problems are specially marked, and each folder contains solutions that adhere to the highest coding standards in terms of efficiency and space optimization.

## Highlights

- **Language**: Java
- **Code quality**: Clean, optimized, and well-commented
- **Testing**: Solutions tested with multiple test cases on LeetCode platform
- **Performance**: Solutions include time and space complexity insights

## Problem Categories

You will find solutions across different categories, including:

- **Arrays and Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Trees and Graphs**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Backtracking**
- **Math**
- **Greedy**
- **Sorting and Searching**
- **Stacks and Queues**

## Performance Metrics

Each solution is committed with detailed performance metrics, such as:

- Time Complexity (runtime)
- Space Complexity (memory usage)

This data is collected from LeetCode's submission results, allowing you to see how each solution performs in real-world scenarios.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository to learn how various problems are solved. Each folder is named after the problem ID, and it contains:

- Java source code (`.java` files)
- Solution description and thought process (in comments)
  
## Recent Problems Solved

Some of the latest problems I've worked on:

- **4Sum**
- **Longest Palindromic Substring**
- **Valid Sudoku**
- **Reverse Linked List**
- **Design Circular Queue**
- **Daily Temperatures**
  
Stay tuned for more updates!
